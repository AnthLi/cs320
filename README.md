## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:
=======
## Getting started
